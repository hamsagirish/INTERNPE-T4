A Connect 4 game project which is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
This classic two-player game, where players take turns dropping colored discs into a grid to connect four in a row, is fully functional and responsive, providing an engaging user experience across devices. 
The project features a sleek, modern design with intuitive controls and smooth animations. 
I implemented game logic in JavaScript, ensuring accurate win detection and seamless gameplay.
